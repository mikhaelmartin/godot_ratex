# Changelog

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- `render_png()`, `render_svg()`, and `render_pdf()` methods — replaces the old `render_latex()` with separate format-specific methods
- SVG output now includes background fill via `<rect>` and converts `rgba()` → hex for Godot's ThorVG compatibility
- `convert_rgba_to_hex()` utility to fix ThorVG colour parsing for embedded glyph paths
- Demo scene now has an **Image Source** dropdown for switching between PNG Buffer and SVG String
- First LaTeX preset is auto-selected on demo launch

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- iOS Simulator on Apple Silicon (`aarch64-apple-ios-sim`) build target
- Release zips now include `demo/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `.gdextension.uid`

### Fixed
- iOS SDK detection in CI — device target correctly uses `iphoneos`, sim targets use `iphonesimulator`

### Changed
- Compiled binaries are no longer tracked in git — they're build artifacts produced by `./build.sh` or CI
- Added `.gitignore` patterns for all GDExtension binary types (`*.so`, `*.dylib`, `*.dll`, `*.a`)
- Removed previously committed LFS pointer files for platform binaries
- Updated icon

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- Windows ARM64 support in CI and `.gdextension`
- Demo scene (`addons/godot_ratex/demo/`) with presets, LaTeX input field, and property controls
- LICENSE (MIT)
- Comprehensive README with API docs, usage examples, and supported platforms table

### Changed
- Renderer refactored to property-based API (`font_size`, `padding`, `background_color`, `font_color`)
- `render_latex()` now reads settings from properties instead of method arguments
- `.gitattributes` configured for Godot Asset Library convention (`export-ignore` rules)
